# Flappy-Bird-ML
My 1st ever ML project 🤩 . 

Made this by using the concepts of **NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** not the NEAT package itself so no external library needed(other than pygame which is used to render the game).

This is the 1st time im attempting an ML program and without any external library so it not might be as good as the other programs

## Important notes :-
The pipes from 21-25 are hard coded so if any bird crosses a score of 25 it is expected to go on infinitly.
Set DUBUG to True on line 17 in main.py to see the 2 best parents of each generation

Expected 15-30 Generations for the program to be trained completly may be less or more

If any bird crosses a score of 25 its values will be printed on the console

**The scope of this project is only the ML of the bird not the entire game**

## How to Run :-
1. Clone/Donload this repo
2. Be sure to have pygame installed and run main.py
